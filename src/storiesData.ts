      `One of our kids is Dylan. He arrived at “Casa Esperanza” when he was two years old. His mother left him behind for unknown reasons. His dad didn’t know how to provide for him because he was too young, homeless, and unable to provide for him. Eventually, he left him with the promise to come back while he looks for a better opportunity in the border between Colombia and Venezuela. Unfortunately, he got sick with tuberculosis making him weak and unable to work.`,
      `Meanwhile, Dylan was living in Casa Esperanza where he received love, care, protection, and the supplies that he needs to grow physically, emotionally, and mentally healthy. Dylan loves Casa Esperanza family; he refers to them like grandpa and grandma because he feels that he belongs and that it is essential for children to grow healthy emotionally. He is attending school and loves to play baseball, and his dream is to become a great baseball player. Casa Esperanza goal is to continue helping and promoting children to grow healthy and providing a safe place with loving and nurturing families.`,
